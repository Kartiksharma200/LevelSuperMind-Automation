# Level Supermind Mobile Automation Testing

### **Project Overview**
This repository contains an automated testing framework designed for testing the Level Supermind mobile app using **Appium**, **Selenium**, and **TestNG**. The primary focus of the automation is to test the Login and Sign-Up functionality, ensuring that both features work as expected across different devices and configurations.

This framework leverages the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, making the tests more maintainable and scalable.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating the browser interactions.
- **Appium**: Open-source mobile application automation tool for Android and iOS.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: To improve maintainability and scalability of the tests.
- **TestNG**: For test execution.
- **Java**: Programming language for test automation.
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project build automation.

### **Features:**

**Login Functionality:**

- Validates correct login with valid credentials.
- Handles login with invalid credentials and shows appropriate error messages.
- Verifies email format validation.

**Sign-Up Functionality:**
  
- Tests valid user sign-up with required fields.
- Verifies error handling for invalid or incomplete form submissions (e.g., password mismatch, invalid email).
- Ensures proper error messages are shown for invalid inputs.
